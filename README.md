# Hate-Speech-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

The aim of this project is to classify speech on social media into hate speech and neutral speech. We have used different machine
learning classification algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. We created our own dataset of 30000 tweets
extracted from Twitter using Tweepy library. We used different preprocessing and data cleaning techniques, trained all 4 models and finally compared
accuracy of each of them. The SVM, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifying techniques have comparatively similar accuracy amongst
which Logistic Regression provided highest accuracy score of 94.11.
